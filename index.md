## What is OpenJPEG ?

OpenJPEG is an open-source JPEG 2000 codec written in C language. It has been developed in order to promote the use of [JPEG 2000](http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg2000), a still-image compression standard from the Joint Photographic Experts Group ([JPEG](http://www.jpeg.org)).  In addition to the basic codec, various other features are under development, among them the JP2 and MJ2 (Motion JPEG 2000) file formats, an indexing tool useful for the JPIP protocol, JPWL-tools for error-resilience, a Java-viewer for j2k-images, ...

## Who can use the code ?

Anyone. As the OpenJPEG code is released under the 2-clauses BSD license, anyone can use or modify the code, even for commercial applications. The only restriction is to retain the copyright in the sources or in the binaries documentation. Of course, if you modified the code in a way that might be of interest for other users, you are encouraged to share it (through a github pull request or by filling an issue) but this is not a requirement.
    
## Who are the developers ?

The library is developed and maintained by the Communications and Remote Sensing Lab (TELE), in the Universit√© catholique de Louvain (UCL), with the support of the CNES, the CS company and the intoPIX company. The JPWL module is developed and maintained by the Digital Signal Processing Lab (DSPLab) of the University of Perugia, Italy (UNIPG).
