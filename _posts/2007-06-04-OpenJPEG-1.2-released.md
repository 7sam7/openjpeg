title: OpenJPEG 1.2 released

{% include JB/setup %}

We're very happy to announce that [OpenJPEG version 1.2](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/releases/tag/version.1.2) has been released. Here are the three main novelties:

  * Digital Cinema: OpenJPEG is now capable of encoding and decoding JPEG 2000 streams compatible with the JPEG Profile-3 (2K images) and Profile-4 (4K images). These profiles correspond to the [DCI specifications](http://www.dcimovies.com/).
  * Optimizations: The two main cores in terms of computation complexity (DWT and T1) have been optimized.
  * TIFF files are now handled. 8,12 and 16 bits per component are allowed.

More generally, the library robustness has been increased and several bugs have been corrected.
Since the library structure has been modified, we have increased the soversion (it is now set to 2).
