{% include JB/setup %}

Thanks to Mathieu Malaterre from the [GDCM project](http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Public/Gdcm/Main.html), CMake files have been added to the cvs repository. CMake is a cross-platform, open-source make system. Makefiles and project files for almost any platform can now easily be generated. Feel free to test them on your own platform and provide feedback.
