title: OpenJPEG 2.1.1 released
---
{% include JB/setup %}

Well, miracles happen, [OpenJPEG 2.1.1](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/releases/tag/v2.1.1) is released today.

No fancy additional features, no API/ABI break compared to OpenJPEG 2.1 â€¦ Mostly a release with the *huge* amount of critical bug fixes brought to the library since 2 years. A release that will therefore mostly interest linux distributions package maintainers.
See full change log [here](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/blob/openjpeg-2.1/CHANGELOG.md).
